                            <li><p>The dimensions that you input indicate that OPG should treat your chart as if it were Width x Height big.</p></li>
                            <li><p>After entering your dimensions and pressing 'save,' the ruler will scale with your chart to show you how many inches long your chart is.</p></li>
                            <li><p>by zooming your chart in and out until the ruler's inch is roughly the same size as an actual inch, you can get a feel for how big your chart is probably going to be.</p></li>

                    <h3>Custom People <span class="label label-warning">NEW</span></h3>
                    <p>This feature allows you to add custom people to the tree in the next generation.
                        For ascendancy-style charts, this means you can add a parent, and for descendancy-style charts it means you can add children.
                        It is designed to help fill in generations for descendancy charts where some people that would otherwise be on the chart are still be living.</p>
                    <p>Due to FamilySearch's privacy policy, One Page Genealogy cannot show information for living people.
                        However, you can create the boxes for these people manually to help you create the tree that you want.
                        This will enable you to create the nodes for the people they want without creating multiple private copies of those people in FamilySearch,
                        and is ideal for filling in the lower generations in descendancy-style charts that may include living persons.
                        It is encouraged that you use this feature for living people.
                        This feature is discouraged as a means of adding information for deceased people,
                        as the information is not saved to FamilySearch. Please use FamilySearch to add information about deceased persons.
                        If you are still unsure about when to use this feature, please review the following guidelines and warnings:

                        <li>Children <i><b style="color: red;">WILL NOT</b></i> be transferable to other charts. They exist solely on the chart for which they are created.</li>

                        <li>A button has been added to the creation page that will allow you to view the parent's profile on FamilySearch and make permanent children there.</li>

                    <h3>Chart Statistics <span class="label label-warning">NEW</span></h3>
                    This feature gives you more information about your chart and family tree. A quick list of the available statistics
                    and what they describe is included below.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Total People:</b> The total number of people included in the chart.</li>
                        <li><b>Percent Male:</b> The total number of males in the chart.</li>
                        <li><b>Percent Female:</b> The total number of female in the chart.</li>
                        <li><b>Percent Unknown Gender:</b> The total number of people in the chart whose gender in not specified.</li>
                        <li><b>Estimated Percent Full:</b> An estimation of how full your chart is. Compares the number of people in your chart with the
                            number of people that should be in your chart. Because trees effectively double in size for every generation added, this tool
                            is most effective on charts of 8 generations or less. In descendancy charts, 4 children per family per generation is used
                            as our (conservative) standard for calculations. Actual percentages for descendancy charts will vary.</li>

                    <p>If your chart is different than you think it should be, check FamilySearch or your loaded Gedcom and make sure that the data is correct there.</p>

                    <p>By default, One Page Genealogy uses the primary name from both FamilySearch and Gedcoms files. Changing the file will allow you to get the correct information</p>

                    <h3>My Chart Takes a Long Time to Load</h3>
                    <p>One Page Genealogy has to download its information from FamilySearch. The larger your chart, the more we have to download.</p>
                    <p>To speed up your loading time, you can do one or more of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Use Fewer Generations</h5>
                            <p>Each generation is exponentially larger than the last. If you don't need that last generation, try loading fewer generations.</p>
                            <p>By default, we download 8 generations, but you can adjust that number both up and down. 8 generations (255 people for a full ascendancy chart!), but should only take a couple of seconds.</p>
                            <p>If you are trying to download more than 11 generations, it may take some time, so be patient. A full 20 generation chart might take a few minutes.</p>
                            <p>Descendancy charts often take far longer per generation to load than Ascendancy charts since each generation includes many more people.
                                Expect a significant delay when loading more than 5 generations. A full 20 generation descendancy chart will take a while.</p>

                    <h3>My Chart Experiences Lag When I Drag it Around or Zoom In/Out</h3>
                    <p>One Page Genealogy uses Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create your chart. These tend to be nice and fast, but there are some limits.</p>
                    <p>Most charts should move fairly fluidly, but will become a little bit harder to move depending on how many boxes you have on screen.</p>
                    <p>If you have 11+ Generations on screen, it is likely that you will start to experience some lag. Try zooming in to reduce the number of boxes on screen, since rendering all of those boxes slows your computer down.</p>

                    <p>Wait a few minutes before you panic. When you upload a chart, One Page Genealogy also uploads the pictures associated with your ancestors.
                        sometimes these pictures can interfere with normal operation if they are still being loaded while you are trying to do other things like
                        load up a new chart.</p>

                    <p>The information for your chart may include some pictures that will render in the boxes alongside all of the other information about your
                        ancestors. Often, these pictures will take a moment or two to load while they are being downloaded into OPG. Pictures should start to be added
                        to your chart within a few seconds of being downloaded. This time will increase as the number of pictures needing download increases.</p>
