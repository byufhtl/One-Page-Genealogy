/**
 * The RenderInstructionSchedule class is designed as a container for information that the renderer will need in addition
 * to the box dimensions in order to render the box as an SVG element. Essentially, it contains a work order for the renderer.
 * The information is set (presumably) by the StyleManager as a style is applied to a box. The Style really consists of
 * creating and then populating this object, after which it attaches this object to the box being stylized. The box will
 * then pass this object to the renderer, which will systematically check for instructions and render the box appropriately
 * based on the instructions and information stored in the box object.

     * Adds an instruction to the schedule. This function is implemented in an interesting, but hopefully useful way.
     * The instruction is a string identifier that the renderer can pick up later. If 1 parameter is included after the

     * identifier will be split into identifier_x and identifier_y, associated with the first and second parameters
     * respectively. This was done to allow the code on the other end to be abbreviated by entering x,y coordinates
     * simultaneously through using the generic static identifiers provided by the class, while still allowing single
     * digit modifiers like font size to be manipulated directly. Also allows for direct parameter manipulation, as well
     * as custom parameters.
     * If it's a mess, you can change it as you like. I was just trying to speed things up a bit with some nifty
     * functions.
