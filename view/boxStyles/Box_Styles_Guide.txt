Box styles dictate the color, shape, style, font, and formatting of the boxes used to represent individual people.
The box styles follow a pretty basic format and template guide.

    I)   Graphics/Setup
    II)  Box Config
        i)   Width/Height Settings
        ii)  Border Settings
        iii) Color Schematics
    III) Text Config
        i)   Name Config
        ii)  Date Config(?)
        iii) Birth Place Config(?)
        iv)  Death Place Config(?)
        v)   Picture Config(?)
    IV)  Translation
    V)   Type
    VI)  Dimensions
    VII) Loading

Most of these settings are almost always identical. Points II, III, and VI are more commonly mutable, since they control
content and appearance rather than movement or loading.
Depending on the content of the box, the number of configuration sections in III may vary.

Text configuration is reliant upon the StringUtils.ts file, which does the text formatting for the box, making the
information fit neatly inside of the box.

New box styles must be registered in BoxStyleFactory.ts file to be included in the functional product.

The box styles are currently undergoing revision and expansion. The formatting to the code blocks is being changed slightly
for readability, and certain functionalities have been moved within the code to allow for cohesive grouping.

The centered style previously featured in some box styles has been removed for consistency.
Features may be added later to allow the user to toggle the justification manually across generations/trees.

The following code was also excised from the code in its commented state. As it may prove useful later, I'm saving it here.

        /*var text6 = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "text");
         g.appendChild(text6);
         var nameTextPath = document.createTextNode("M: marriage place (year)");
         text6.appendChild(nameTextPath);
         text6.setAttribute("x", "110");
         text6.setAttribute("y", "102");
         text6.setAttribute("font-size", "15px");
         //        StringUtils.centerElement(text6, 40, 240);*/

This bit was in the first line of all of the styles Translation functions, always commented out. Excised and stored here.

        //graphic.setAttribute("transform","translate("+(box.getX()+2)+", "+(box.getY()+4)+")");

Box widths were also strange, since the return value was a sum of two magic numbers, and a third magic number commented-
out off to one side. The summed numbers were converted into a single number, and the commented-out number was removed.
